- [ ] Develop central orchestrator for agent coordination

## Phase 3: Develop Survey Type Classification Layer
- [ ] Implement pre-processing module for survey classification
- [ ] Integrate machine learning models for survey type detection

## Phase 4: Implement Semantic Anchoring for Question Mapping
- [ ] Integrate embedding-based similarity models (e.g., SentenceTransformers)
- [ ] Develop question mapping to known templates

## Phase 5: Integrate Multi-LLM Backend Switching
- [ ] Integrate multiple LLM providers (Ollama, HuggingFace, Groq, etc.)
- [ ] Implement dynamic routing layer based on question type or latency
- [ ] Benchmark performance across different LLMs

## Phase 6: Develop Observer Mode for Agent Swarms
